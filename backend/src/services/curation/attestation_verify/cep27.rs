//! CEP-27 conda publish-attestation verification (#4048).
//!
//! # What was wrong
//!
//! The conda attestation endpoint used to check the in-toto Statement's
//! *shape*: `_type`, `predicateType`, exactly one subject, subject name ==
//! filename, subject digest == the package's stored sha256. That is
//! well-formedness, not verification. No signature was checked, no
//! transparency-log entry, no identity. The only thing binding the document to
//! the package was a digest, and **an attacker who can write to the channel
//! controls both the package and the digest** — so they can always write a
//! matching attestation. It was attestation theatre in exactly the sense
//! [`super`] was written to prevent for PyPI.
//!
//! # What CEP-27 actually says
//!
//! The Statement is distributed **only inside a Sigstore bundle**, never as
//! bare JSON. The old endpoint therefore accepted the unsigned *payload* of an
//! attestation and rejected every real one, so there is no
//! backwards-compatible client to preserve: a bare Statement is now rejected
//! outright with [`BARE_STATEMENT_REASON`].
//!
//! # How this module verifies
//!
//! [`verify_conda_bundle`] runs [`super::CORE_CHECKS`] — the same
//! ecosystem-agnostic transport chain PyPI runs, including the Rekor inclusion
//! proof and SET glue the `sigstore` crate skips — and then appends
//! [`Check::StatementPolicy`], which applies the CEP-27 rules
//! ([`check_statement`]) to the statement the DSSE signature has *already*
//! vouched for. Satisfying the policy check therefore requires the Fulcio
//! signing key, not a text editor.
//!
//! [`Check::PublisherOwnerBound`] is absent by construction, not by oversight:
//! it compares the cert-bound owner against PyPI's self-asserted
//! `publisher.repository`, and CEP-27 has no claimed-publisher field to compare
//! against. See [`super::CONDA_CHECKS`].
//!
//! # Where it runs
//!
//! The CEP-27 upload path (`PUT /conda/{repo}/{subdir}/{filename}/attestation`,
//! `store_attestation` in the conda handler) calls [`verify_conda_bundle`]
//! with a digest the server streams out of storage and hashes itself, persists
//! the outcome under [`VERIFICATION_METADATA_KEY`] next to the stored
//! attestation so [`record_to_verdict`] can read it back, and — when
//! `CONDA_ATTESTATION_REQUIRE_VERIFIED` is on (the fail-closed default) —
//! refuses any attestation that does not verify, storing nothing. Only an
//! explicit operator opt-out accepts an unverified attestation, and then the
//! failed record is stored with it so the gap stays auditable.
